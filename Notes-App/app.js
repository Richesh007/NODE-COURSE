//Learning from Section-3 Chapter-11 (Importing NPM modules) 
    //To start with NPM modules we need to use NPM commands (NPM stands for Node Package Manager). NPM comes as a core module with Node.js as console.
    // The very first command is "npm init" which should be ran into root directory of your project. 
    // It will create a package.json file which is nothing but config file of the project as a default custom Package of the project
    // It will also contain other NPM package info which is installed using "npm install <package name>" for this project
